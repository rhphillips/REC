    <string name="b_e_info">Back extension is used for strengthening the lower back (mostly erector spinae). It is done by using a back extension machine where body pushes a weight backwards. Try 3 sets of 5 exercises.</string>
    <string name="b_f_info">The Back Fly Machine involves grasping two handles at shoulder height, and pushing them together while keeping the elbows at a constant angle. It is used to  work the muscles of the upper body, primarily the sternal head of the pectoralis major.</string>
    <string name="b_c_info">The Bicep Curl Machine is used for strengthening the biceps. It involves a weight moving through an arc, primarily using the strength of the biceps.</string>
    <string name="chest_press_info">The Chest Press focuses on the development of the pectoralis major muscle as well as other supporting muscles including the anterior deltoids, serratus anterior, coracobrachialis, scapulae fixers, trapezii, and the triceps. The person lowers a weight to the level of the chest, then pushes it back up until the arm is straight.</string>
    <string name="incline_press_info">An Incline Press elevates the shoulders and lowers the pelvis as if reclining in a chair; It emphasizes anterior deltoids and emphasizes the upper (clavicular head) of the pectoralis major. </string>
    <string name="title_activity_map_screen2">Second Floor</string>
    <string name="l_p_info">The Lat Pulldown is designed to develop the latissimus dorsi muscle. It is done where the handle is moved via a cable pulley. It requires dynamic work by muscles surrounding the three joints which move during the exercise. These are the elbow in conjunction with the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints in the shoulder girdle.</string>
    <string name="l_e_info">The Leg Extension a resistance weight training exercise that targets the quadriceps muscle in the legs. It should not be considered as a total leg workout.</string>
    <string name="p_f_info">The Pec Fly primarily works the pectoralis major muscles to move the arms horizontally forward. The hands are usually brought out further than the elbows, in which case the flexors contract isometrically to inhibit undesired excess flexion of the elbow.</string>
    <string name="rcp_info">The Rotary Chest Press primarily works the pectoralis major and secondarily works the triceps. Press handles forward till arms are fully extended. Return to starting position without letting weights touch the stack and perform upward motion again.</string>
    <string name="rip_info">The Rotary Incline Press </string>
    <string name="rlp_info">The Rotary Lat Pulldown functions very similarly to the Lat Pulldown machine, but provides a greater focus on the shoulders in addition to the back.</string>
    <string name="rsr_info">The Rotary Seated Row is an exercise where the purpose is to strengthen the muscles that draw the rower\'s arms toward the body (latissimus dorsi) as well as those that retract the scapulae (trapezius and rhomboids) and those that support the spine (erector spinae).</string>
    <string name="rsp_info">The Rotary Shoulder Press is performed by a weight pressing straight upwards from the shoulders until it is locked out overhead.</string>
    <string name="slc_info">The Seated Leg Curl is an isolation exercise that targets the hamstring muscles. The exercise involves flexing the lower leg against resistance towards the buttocks.</string>
    <string name="sr_info">The Seated Row is an exercise where the purpose is to strengthen the muscles that draw the rower\'s arms toward the body (latissimus dorsi) as well as those that retract the scapulae (trapezius and rhomboids) and those that support the spine (erector spinae).</string>
    <string name="te_info">The Tricep Extension works the triceps from the elbow all the way to the latissimus dorsi. It is one of the most stimulating exercises to the entire triceps muscle group in the upper arm.</string>
